# Space Beer 2023 - Cloud Space External

This repo holds the code for our Space Beer app.
The Model is deployed on Google App Engine and uses Flask as a microframework.

#### The project is for educational purposes: 
- Get to know GCP / GAE (Google App Engine)
- Get familiar with Flask
- Get familiar with GCP Cloud console or Cloud SDK
- Get familiar with TensorFlow Hub and Transfer Learning

#### Image classification and ranking problem:
Image classification is a supervised learning problem. We define a set of target classes (in our case Beer pours), and train a model to recognize them using labeled example data. In our example, we will make use of TensorFlow 2.x in order to build, train, and optimize our model.
